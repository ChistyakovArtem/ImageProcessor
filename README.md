# ImageProcessor

This is my Image Processor - framework for working with bmp images including **Cropping, GrayScaling, Edge Detection, Gaussian Bluring, Median bluring, Noise cleaning...**

It is written in **pure C++ using OOP paradigm** and such techniques as **abstract classes, virtual methods, multi-inheritance, namespaces and unit-testing**.

Framework supports reading from terminal and **absolutely fail-safe** including safe fails after getting bad commands, bad parameters (or no parameters) and bad file types.

Framework has strong carcass that allow to easily add new filters and modify olds. Framework is free of UB and memory leakages.
